# OBS scripts collection
In this repo you can find some LUA scripts I made for OBS because I needed some specific functionality I couldn't find anywhere.
I hope they are useful for others too :)

### List with description
- **Autostart**:  as the name implies, it simply starts a program automatically when OBS is opened, it has also a toggle to enable or disable it so you don't need to remove it from the scripts list

### Bugs
These are my first experiments with LUA, so if you find bugs or if you have suggestions please create a PR or an issue, thanks!
